    <div class="container"><p><h1 style="color: black;">Coronavirus (COVID-19) Travel Updates</h1>
        AdvenTour, like all other operators have been dealing with an unprecedented and challenging impact to our services through 2020 and 2021. Whilst borders are reopening and rules are relaxing there is one thing that remains a constant for our customers: We offer a 100% money back, no quibble guarantee should an event such as a pandemic stop us from fulfilling your dreams of exploration.
        
        Given the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have updated our Terms & Conditions to adapt to the constantly evolving nature of this pandemic. AdvenTour will continually review the guidance from the World Health Organisation and the governments of the countries in which we intend to operate. We are maintaining regular contact with our destination partners, and should extra measures be put in place; we will provide necessary updates.
        
        For the latest information and updates regarding your travel plans, you should either contact us or check the latest advice at - Gov of India (www.india.gov.in/)
        
        In fact, irrespective of who you travel with (we hope it's with us!) or where you are heading you should always check out the latest FCO advice. It's not just pandemics. It's earthquakes, unrest or just instability that you should always be up to speed with. AdvenTour will never put you or your group at risk and that means that there may be occasions when we disappoint you, but we promise, it's because we want you to be safe and have an amazing time.
        
        <h2 style="color: black;">Travel Advice</h2>
        AdvenTour follows government travel advisories from our key traveller markets when making decisions about operating trips in destinations. As the advice may differ depending on your location, it is important to consult your own local foreign travel advisory when considering if travel to a destination is permitted or appropriate for you.
        
        The world is open, but there are restrictions to travel post pandemic. Again, always consult the advice of the Indian government at the following link:
        
         (www.india.gov.in/)
        
        <h2 style="color: black;">Trip / Date Amendments</h2>
        It is the aim of AdvenTour to continue providing a safe, reliable, and informative service. As such, any trip you book through AdvenTour which subsequently has to be postponed due to further outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus, or any other Force Majeure Event, your trip will be put on hold until such a time your group decides on an alternative date to rebook the trip.
        
        Postponement and rebooking of your trip will incur no additional fees.
        
        In addition, if you have any questions about your trip and trip destination, our friendly team are more than happy to discuss it with you.
        
        Stay safe, travel well and most of all have fun and leave only footprints.</p>
